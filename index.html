          I am a full stack software development nerd. For the past 5 years I
          have either worked freelance or lead a team through a wide variety
          of projects. Recently I've been focusing on a few personal projects
          while watching The Price is Right and honing my Mario Kart skills.

            Contract software development. I started working on my own doing
            freelance design, which seamlessly evolved into full stack software
            development (my true love). Ultimately this work evolved into a team
            of 5 and a few healthy projects for the final year until we all went
            our separate ways in early 2012. RenderGarden was one of the most
            fulfilling things I have ever been a part of.

            I've certainly done things the hard way. Writing code for a decade,
            starting a business, getting married and keeping my wits the whole
            time; that's my education.

            It started out as a personal project, building a simple recipe site,
            it turned into the culmination of an old idea: users should learn
            their way through an application. Trading text-field overkill for
            natural language processing and directions for simplicity mean a
            user has to think less and will become emotionally attached to the
            application's experience.

            After working with far to many control freaks who didn't know how to
            let the software team be agile, I decided to look into a happier
            solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although far from complete, the general concept and implementation
            is to build an interface around behavior driven development (with a
            language such as Cucumber). The "brains" can add their feature
            requests in a comfortable interface which will directly be added to
            a bucket for review by the software team. From there, the feature is
            automatically tracked through the development cycle and will be
            reported on as necessary.

            A three part Node.js application that follows log files and streams
            them to any number of external harvesting nodes. In reality, this
            was used in production to stream a variety of flat text files in
            real-time. Alonso is simple, small and awesome.
